# Calculator
INTRODUCTION:

This is a user-friendly web application code that performs basic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which makes the webpage visually appealing.

INSTALLATION:

When it comes to installing and utilizing the code on your system, you'll need two essential types of files: HTML files and CSS files. üñ•Ô∏è 

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of your webpage, providing the structure and content, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the visual styling and layout, enhancing the overall appearance. üé®

To get started, save both the HTML and CSS files in the same folder on your computer. üìÇ This is crucial, as the HTML file will reference the CSS file to apply the necessary styles. Once saved, open the HTML file in a web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, to see your webpage rendered with all its graphics and design elements. üåê

If the files are not stored together, the browser will not be able to locate the CSS file, resulting in a page that lacks proper styles and visuals. ‚ùå This may lead to a less appealing and functional user experience. Therefore, keeping both files in the same directory is essential for achieving the desired display of your webpage. ‚úÖ
